    "When reading text, understanding the type of entities with the text helps extract additional information about the entity. Through the use of Named Entity Recognition (NER), we are able to determine whether an entity is a Person, Organization, Country, ... When exploring text online, we also occassionally see entities have clickable links to webpages with more information on the entity. This is a form of enhancing the text to allow readers to easily access the information needed to understand each entity from the text and its content.    \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will be revisiting the Covid-19 related news dataset from notebook 7 to explore how we can improve spaCy's NER disambiguation and enhance the text from the news articles through the use of entity linking. This will be done in two parts, where we first use text coherence for NER disambiguation and then perform text enhancement with entity linking.    \n",

    "Now that you saw that spaCy NER does not always perform correctly, we will try to use text coherence to modify the NER types that spaCy gave.  In fact spaCy assigns the entity types one sentence at a time.  But when looking a the whole document, and knowing that text is usually coherent, we can do some post-processing to spaCy's NER module and correct some mistakes.  By text being coherent, we mean, for example, that if a person is referred to with a particular name, e.g. *McGeer*, chances are that each time we see *McGeer* in the document, it is the same person.  So it is unlikely that *McGeer* would be once a person and once an organization.  It is not always true, but it is a common assumption.  Therefore, we will explore two different strategies to use text coherence to post-process the output from the spaCy NER module.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first strategy (*explored in Q2/Q3*) is to find, among all NER types assigned, which is the most frequent one.  For example, the entity *Bourouiba* was assigned 1 time GPE, and 3 times PERSON, so this information can be used to modify the GPE type and change it to PERSON.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The second strategy (explored in Q4) is to try to find a longer form in the text.  Since that longer form should be less ambiguous, we can use it to disambiguate the shorter, more ambiguous forms.  For example, *Lydia Bourouiba* occurs in the text and is assigned PERSON.  We can use that information to assign further occurrences of the short form *Bourouiba* to also be PERSON.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we defined these two strategies, they can be combined in different ways. So, in Q5, you are asked to combine both strategies in a post-processing component for spaCy NER module.   Of course, using this text coherence will not work every time, and will unfortunately introduce some errors...  But let's try."

Specifically, we will perform NER type validation to ensure that when we enhance text with a resource that it only enhanced entities of the correct NER type.

Thus, you only need to ensure that if at least one entity of the same surface form contains the NER type and is in the text, then all instances of those entities are updated. If a resource contains the entities in the text, but they are all of a different type, ignore them. You are free to implement the more robust method detailed above if you like, but are recommended to perform the more simplistic approach that the question asks for."
